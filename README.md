### Short Description about the project
  Decision making in businesses in recent times are being supported by intelligent decision support systems (DSSs) via machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM). Research has shown that business intelligence (such ML and DM) approaches contribute significantly to both personal and intelligent DSSs. Direct marketing campaigns such as contacting clients via phone calls, emails, or promotional letters have been made more accessible in this age of technology. Previous studies have shown that discriminatively direct marketing campaigns yield high success rates compared with the mass campaigns that target the general public. In particular, the direct marketing strategy essentially targets a fraction of the public who will be keenly interested in a product or service. Although this marketing strategy may appear to intrude the privacy of potential clients, it has by far yielded some positive outcomes as against the conventional mass campaigning strategies.

  A Portuguese bank's data on direct marketing campaign using phone calls was selected for this study. The objective of the study is to explore several DM and ML methods in extracting relevant explanatory and predictive patterns underlying the various input variables and the single two-level categorical response variable. Four DM and DL methods are used in this study: K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), artificial neural networks (ANN), gradient boosted machine (GBM), and support vector machine (SVM). Specifically, the classification task is to predict whether or not a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit. The study is expected to answer relevant research questions such as what factors determine a client's interest in taking a term deposit, and what negative outlook will a bank receive when it keeps intruding clients privacy via phone calls.
