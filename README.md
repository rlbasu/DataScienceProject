## Project Details

Title: "Determining Term Deposits"

Author: Wedam Nyaaba, Charles Harrison, Basu Lamichhane, and Salvatore Cracchiolo

Date Completed : "May 11, 2017"

### Short Description about the project
   A Portuguese bank's data on direct marketing campaign using phone calls was selected for this study. The objective of the study is to explore several DM and ML methods in extracting relevant explanatory and predictive patterns underlying the various input variables and the single two-level categorical response variable. Four DM and DL methods are used in this study: K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), artificial neural networks (ANN), gradient boosted machine (GBM), and support vector machine (SVM). Specifically, the classification task is to predict whether or not a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit. The study is expected to answer relevant research questions such as what factors determine a client's interest in taking a term deposit, and what negative outlook will a bank receive when it keeps intruding clients privacy via phone calls.
